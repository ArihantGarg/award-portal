# DESIGN: Add new Award Committee form

This is a simple form designed by me [@Aryan Shinde](https://www.github.com/hetref). This looks much simpler but I've added a little backend in it as I am good known with backend. I am sorry I didn't completed the task completed but I added some more features in it which I guess can be very useful in the form. Here's the list of the features included in the form:

## Features

- Taking Inputs (Basic)
- Add committee member's details
- On hovering committee member's name you'll get their email
- On submitting the form the committee chair and committee members received an instant update about the committee.
